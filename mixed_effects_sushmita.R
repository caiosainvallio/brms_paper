# When to Use? ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Studies that obtain multiple measurements over time (longitudinal, 
# time-series) or multiple trials per participant (within subjects) lend 
# themselves well to mixed model analyses.


# Important terminology ------------------------------------------------------

## Crossed designs -----------------------------------------------------------
# Refer to the within-subject variables (i.e. timepoint, condition, etc.). 
# Crossed designs occur when multiple measurements are associated with multiple
# grouping variables. In a completely crossed design, all subjects provide 
# responses for all conditions/time-points.


## Nested designs 
# refer to the between-subject variable. Generally this is a higher-level 
# variable that subjects or items are grouped under.
